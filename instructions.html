        <p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> This is a demo banking website made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        </i><p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> There is no data base implemented in this project, so you cannot make an account
              and/or save changes in the transaction movements. Every time you reload the webpage, all the data
              will reset.
            </p>
            <p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> You can transfer money between accounts, take a loan and delete accounts.</p>
            <p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> The username of any user is the initials of that user in lowercase and without spaces. So, for
                example, the username of the user 'Vedang Danej' will be 'vd'.
            </p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> To transfer between accounts, enter the username of the user (initials).</p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> The maximum amount of loan given by the bank is ten times the maximum deposit 
                made previously. This can be used to get an infinite amount of loan from the bank (or at least as much as 'let' can safely store).
            </p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> Again, to delete an account, use the username and not the name of the user.</p>
             <p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> <a href="/people.html" target="_blank">These people</a> have accounts in the bank.</p>
            <p> <i class="fas fa-hand-point-right"></i> The PIN for every user is 1111.</p>
